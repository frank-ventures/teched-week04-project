# Week Four Project

## Project- Building a Full Stack Application: 

This week we were to combine front-end display and interactivity, with backend management of inputs and data, making use of Node,js, Express and SQL

There were three main sections to the project this week:

- A user can visit a website and read information.
- A user can contribute to the page (like a message in a guestbook).
- A user can see the other contributions that other guests have made.

I kept track of my thoughts and tasks here: [https://frankjs.notion.site/Day-Seventeen-project-38847db1da6f4444b0992459944ef17c?pvs=4](https://frankjs.notion.site/Day-Seventeen-project-38847db1da6f4444b0992459944ef17c?pvs=4)
